For this project, I downloaded the complete package and stored `Data1_xfg.csv` in the local `data/` directory of the RStudio project (this file is not published to GitHub to maintain data-sharing boundaries).\nThe dataset comprises 21 RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases gathered between May and July 2025 from three surveillance platforms in coastal Kenya. Each row represents a single participant or sample.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Load raw data and perform initial cleaning\n# This chunk reads the raw CSV file, cleans variable names,and creates derived variables needed for later analysis.\nlibrary(tidyverse) # data wrangling and visualization\nlibrary(lubridate) # date handling\nlibrary(janitor) # clean variable names\n\nData_xfg_raw <- readr::read_csv(\"/Users/ldh/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/USC PhD/STUDY DOCUMENTS/Fall 2025/PM 566/Final Project/PM 566 Final Project/PM-566-Final-Project/data/Data1_xfg.csv\")\nData_xfg <- Data_xfg_raw %>%\n  janitor::clean_names() %>%\n  mutate(\n    date_collect = lubridate::dmy(date_collect),\n    lineage_group = if_else(\n      stringr::str_starts(nextclade_pango2, \"XFG\"),\n      \"XFG lineage\", \"Other lineages\"\n    ),\n    lineage_group = factor(lineage_group),\n    clinical_status = factor(clinical_status,\n                             levels = c(\"asymptomatic\", \"symptomatic\")),\n    study = factor(study,\n                   levels = c(\"HF\", \"pricos\", \"ResViRe\"))\n  )\n```\n:::\n\nFollowing the cleaning process, no observations were discarded; all 21 samples were preserved. The variable date_collect was transformed into a Date class with lubridate::dmy(). The lineage variable nextclade_pango2 was reclassified into a more straightforward two-level factor lineage_group (“XFG lineage” vs “Other lineages”). The variables study, clinical_status, and age_group were specifically designated as factors to guarantee uniform ordering in tables and figures. No imputation was conducted.\n\n# Exploratory plots\nThis section's charts aim to illustrate the age distribution of participants and the general prevalence of reported symptoms.
