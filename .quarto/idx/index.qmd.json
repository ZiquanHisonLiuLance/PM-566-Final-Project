Introduction\nThe recombinant SARS-CoV-2 lineage XFG emerged as a worldwide predominant variation in 2025. Nonetheless, global supremacy does not inherently suggest homogeneous local dissemination. Comprehending the circulation of XFG in various contexts is crucial for assessing its public health implications and for devising genetic surveillance measures.This project examines publicly accessible replication data from Lambisia et al. (2025), who studied XFG transmission in coastal Kenya. The dataset comprises 21 RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases collected from May to July 2025 across three surveillance platforms: a hospital-based cohort (HF), a primary-care respiratory infection cohort (pricos), and a community-based surveillance project (ResViRe). The data for each participant encompass fundamental demographics, RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values, viral lineage classifications, and self-reported symptoms. Our objective is to delineate patterns in Ct values, symptoms, and viral lineages among study groups, as well as to illustrate the frequency of XFG detection.\n\n# 2. Mothods\n## 2.1 Data and Study Population: \nThe replication dataset was obtained from the Harvard Dataverse repository (DOI: 10.7910/DVN/LJEYL6). The study comprises 21 people with proven SARS-CoV-2 infection from three surveillance studies undertaken in coastal Kenya: HF, pricos, and ResViRe. Each participant had access to the following essential variables:\nStudy identifier (study: HF, pricos, ResViRe)\nDemographics: sex, age in years, age group\nVirologic measures: RT-PCR Ct value (ct_value) and sampling date (date_collect)\nGenomic lineage designation (nextclade_pango2)\nClinical status (clinical_status: asymptomatic vs symptomatic)\nSymptom indicators (sys_cough, sys_headache, sys_runny_nose,\nsys_sore_throat, sys_chestpain, sys_fever)\nOnly the 21 observations contained in the replication dataset were examined. \n## 2.2 Statistical analysis\n```{r}\n# Descriptive baseline table (Table 1)\n# This chunk creates a publication-style descriptive table of participant characteristics stratified by study, using arsenal::tableby() and kableExtra.\n\n# 1.

The stacked bars indicate that the majority of sequenced samples were categorized as other lineages, aligning with the restricted local transmission of XFG during the study period.\n\n## 3.2 Sampling timeline\n```{r collection-timeline}\n# This chunk visualizes when samples were collected over time,stratified by study and lineage group. Each point is one participant.\n\ntimeline_data <- Data_xfg %>%                      # start from the cleaned analysis dataset\n  dplyr::filter(!is.na(date_collect))              # keep only observations with a valid collection date\nggplot(\n  timeline_data,\n  aes(\n    x     = date_collect,                          # x-axis: sample collection date\n    y     = study,                                 # y-axis: study (HF, pricos, ResViRe)\n    color = lineage_group,                         # color: XFG vs Other lineages\n    shape = clinical_status                        # shape: symptomatic vs asymptomatic\n  )\n) +\n  geom_jitter(\n    width  = 0,                                    # no horizontal jitter (date is exact)\n    height = 0.1,                                  # slight vertical jitter to avoid overplotting\n    size   = 2.5                                   # point size\n  ) +\n  scale_x_date(date_labels = \"%b %d\") +            # show month + day on the x-axis\n  labs(\n    title = \"Sampling timeline of SARS-CoV-2 infections by study and lineage\",\n    x     = \"Sample collection date (2025)\",\n    y     = \"Study\",\n    color = \"Lineage group\",\n    shape = \"Clinical status\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n# Expected result: A dot plot over time showing when each sample was collected in each study, with colors distinguishing XFG vs other lineages and shapes showing symptoms.\n```\nThe sampling period indicated that the 21 illnesses were gathered over a limited timeframe from May to July 2025. XFG infections manifest as discrete occurrences across this timeframe, rather than exhibiting concentrated temporal clusters. This visual pattern aligns with minimal local transmission of XFG in this context. Nonetheless, the exceedingly tiny sample number constrains any definitive conclusions.\n\n## 3.3 Ct values by clinical status and lineage\n```{r}\n# Ct value distribution by clinical status and lineage\n\n# This chunk plots Ct values by clinical status (asymptomatic vs symptomatic), with color indicating lineage_group (XFG vs Other).\n## Boxplots are only drawn for groups with at least 2 observations to avoid misleading \"boxplots\" representing a single data point.\n\n# 1.

There is some indication that symptomatic infections may exhibit somewhat lower Ct values (indicating higher viral load); however, the sample size within each subgroup is exceedingly limited, thus these trends should be regarded as merely descriptive.\n\n## 3.4 Simple regression: association between Ct and symptoms\n```{r}\n# Create binary outcome: symptomatic vs asymptomatic\n## We first create a simple 0/1 variable for symptoms.\n## 1 = symptomatic, 0 = asymptomatic.\n## This avoids having a long expression like (clinical_status == \"symptomatic\") inside the model formula, which previously created ugly term names and broke the labeling code.\n\nData_xfg <- Data_xfg %>%                   # start from main analysis dataset\n  dplyr::mutate(\n    symptomatic = dplyr::if_else(          # create new binary outcome\n      clinical_status == \"symptomatic\",    # condition: symptomatic vs asymptomatic\n      1L,                                  # code 1 for symptomatic\n      0L,                                  # code 0 for asymptomatic\n      missing = NA_integer_                # keep NA as NA (if any)\n    )\n  )\n\n# Fit simple logistic regression model\n# Outcome: symptomatic (1/0)\n# Predictors: Ct value (continuous), lineage group, age in years.\n# This is purely exploratory and *not* the main focus of the project.\n# The main project goal remains descriptive, but this model can be a bonus.\n\nsymp_model <- glm(\n  symptomatic ~ ct_value + lineage_group + age_years,  # model formula\n  data   = Data_xfg %>%\n    dplyr::filter(                                     # keep only complete cases\n      !is.na(symptomatic),\n      !is.na(ct_value),\n      !is.na(age_years),\n      !is.na(lineage_group)\n    ),\n  family = binomial()                                  # logistic regression\n)\n\n# Tidy model output and make a clean, readable table\n# We exponentiate the coefficients to get odds ratios (OR),\n# and then add 95% confidence intervals and p-values.\n\nsymp_results <- broom::tidy(\n  symp_model,\n  conf.int    = TRUE,    # add confidence intervals\n  exponentiate = TRUE    # report OR instead of log-odds\n) %>%\n  dplyr::mutate(\n    # Relabel the term column to something human-readable.\n    # Note: we now have clean term names: \"(Intercept)\", \"ct_value\",\n    # \"lineage_groupOther lineages\", \"age_years\".\n    term = dplyr::case_when(\n      term == \"(Intercept)\" ~\n        \"Intercept (baseline: XFG lineage, younger age)\",\n      term == \"ct_value\" ~\n        \"Ct value (per 1 unit higher)\",\n      term == \"lineage_groupOther lineages\" ~\n        \"Other vs XFG lineages\",\n      term == \"age_years\" ~\n        \"Age (per 1 year older)\",\n      TRUE ~ term                                   # default: keep original\n    ),\n    # Round numbers for a clean table\n    estimate  = round(estimate, 2),                 # odds ratio\n    conf.low  = round(conf.low, 2),                 # lower 95% CI\n    conf.high = round(conf.high, 2),                # upper 95% CI\n    p.value   = signif(p.value, 2)                  # p-value with 2 sig digits\n  ) %>%\n  dplyr::select(\n    Term              = term,                       # rename columns for display\n    `Odds ratio`      = estimate,\n    `95% CI (lower)`  = conf.low,\n    `95% CI (upper)`  = conf.high,\n    `p-value`         = p.value\n  )\n\n# Print the table in a stable, low-bug way\n# Here we use knitr::kable instead of gt. kable is simpler and tends to fail less\n# on Quarto/GitHub Pages.

Nevertheless, confidence intervals were broad and frequently encompass the null, indicating the restricted knowledge derived from merely 21 observations.\n\n## 3.5 Symptom profiles across studies\n```{r symptom-profiles, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\n# This code chunk creates a descriptive bar plot showing, for each participating study (HF, pricos, ResViRe), the proportion of participants reporting each symptom\n# (cough, headache, runny nose, sore throat, chest pain, fever).\n# It is purely descriptive and helps compare symptom patterns across studies for a general audience.\n\n# 1.

Patterns vary among investigations; for instance, respiratory symptoms are more prevalent in the pricos and ResViRe trials compared to HF. However, these discrepancies are derived from limited sample sizes and should be understood intuitively rather than numerically.\n\n# 4. Conclusion and Summary\nThis descriptive analysis of 21 SARS-CoV-2 positive samples from coastal Kenya indicated that the XFG recombinant lineage represented a modest proportion of infections across surveillance studies. It implied restricted local transmission throughout the research period. Ct values and symptom profiles exhibited considerable similarity between XFG and non-XFG lineages, as well as between symptomatic and asymptomatic infections, with only weak and highly ambiguous patterns observed in a limited exploratory regression model.\nDue to the limited sample size, all conclusions should be regarded as illustrative rather than conclusive. This project primarily illustrated the process of importing, cleaning, summarizing, and visualizing a publically available replication dataset with reproducible R and Quarto routines. Subsequent research with larger datasets may implement analogous workflows while integrating more stringent modeling, adjustments for possible confounding factors, and formal uncertainty quantification.","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n```{r setup, include=FALSE}\n# Global knitr options & general setup\n# This chunk sets global options for all code chunks.\n# It is hidden in the rendered website (include = FALSE).\n\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(\n  echo    = TRUE,   # show code by default\n  warning = FALSE,  # hide warnings in the final report\n  message = FALSE   # hide package loading messages\n)\n```\n\n```{r}\n# requried packages:\n# Load required packages\nlibrary(tidyverse) # data manipulation (dplyr, tidyr) and visualization (ggplot2)\nlibrary(lubridate) # convenient tools for working with dates\nlibrary(janitor) # clean variable names and simple tabulations\nlibrary(arsenal) # tableby(): create publication-style descriptive tables\nlibrary(kableExtra) # additional styling for HTML tables\nlibrary(plotly) # turn ggplot figures into interactive graphics\nlibrary(broom) # convert model objects into tidy data frames\n```\n\n```{r}\n# Load and prepare analysis dataset\n# This chunk reads the raw CSV file, cleans variable names,and creates derived variables used throughout the report.\n\n# 1.

Introduction\nThe recombinant SARS-CoV-2 lineage XFG emerged as a worldwide predominant variation in 2025. Nonetheless, global supremacy does not inherently suggest homogeneous local dissemination. Comprehending the circulation of XFG in various contexts is crucial for assessing its public health implications and for devising genetic surveillance measures.This project examines publicly accessible replication data from Lambisia et al. (2025), who studied XFG transmission in coastal Kenya. The dataset comprises 21 RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases collected from May to July 2025 across three surveillance platforms: a hospital-based cohort (HF), a primary-care respiratory infection cohort (pricos), and a community-based surveillance project (ResViRe). The data for each participant encompass fundamental demographics, RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values, viral lineage classifications, and self-reported symptoms. Our objective is to delineate patterns in Ct values, symptoms, and viral lineages among study groups, as well as to illustrate the frequency of XFG detection.\n\n# 2. Mothods\n## 2.1 Data and Study Population: \nThe replication dataset was obtained from the Harvard Dataverse repository (DOI: 10.7910/DVN/LJEYL6). The study comprises 21 people with proven SARS-CoV-2 infection from three surveillance studies undertaken in coastal Kenya: HF, pricos, and ResViRe. Each participant had access to the following essential variables:\nStudy identifier (study: HF, pricos, ResViRe)\nDemographics: sex, age in years, age group\nVirologic measures: RT-PCR Ct value (ct_value) and sampling date (date_collect)\nGenomic lineage designation (nextclade_pango2)\nClinical status (clinical_status: asymptomatic vs symptomatic)\nSymptom indicators (sys_cough, sys_headache, sys_runny_nose,\nsys_sore_throat, sys_chestpain, sys_fever)\nOnly the 21 observations contained in the replication dataset were examined. \n## 2.2 Statistical analysis\n```{r}\n# Descriptive baseline table (Table 1)\n# This chunk creates a publication-style descriptive table of participant characteristics stratified by study, using arsenal::tableby() and kableExtra.\n\n# 1.

The stacked bars indicate that the majority of sequenced samples were categorized as other lineages, aligning with the restricted local transmission of XFG during the study period.\n\n## 3.2 Sampling timeline\n```{r collection-timeline}\n# This chunk visualizes when samples were collected over time,stratified by study and lineage group.

XFG infections manifest as discrete occurrences across this timeframe, rather than exhibiting concentrated temporal clusters. This visual pattern aligns with minimal local transmission of XFG in this context. Nonetheless, the exceedingly tiny sample number constrains any definitive conclusions.\n\n## 3.3 Ct values by clinical status and lineage\n```{r}\n# Ct value distribution by clinical status and lineage\n\n# This chunk plots Ct values by clinical status (asymptomatic vs symptomatic), with color indicating lineage_group (XFG vs Other).\n## Boxplots are only drawn for groups with at least 2 observations to avoid misleading \"boxplots\" representing a single data point.\n\n# 1.

There is some indication that symptomatic infections may exhibit somewhat lower Ct values (indicating higher viral load); however, the sample size within each subgroup is exceedingly limited, thus these trends should be regarded as merely descriptive.\n\n## 3.4 Simple regression: association between Ct and symptoms\n```{r}\n# Create binary outcome: symptomatic vs asymptomatic\n## We first create a simple 0/1 variable for symptoms.\n## 1 = symptomatic, 0 = asymptomatic.\n## This avoids having a long expression like (clinical_status == \"symptomatic\") inside the model formula, which previously created ugly term names and broke the labeling code.\n\nData_xfg <- Data_xfg %>%                   # start from main analysis dataset\n  dplyr::mutate(\n    symptomatic = dplyr::if_else(          # create new binary outcome\n      clinical_status == \"symptomatic\",    # condition: symptomatic vs asymptomatic\n      1L,                                  # code 1 for symptomatic\n      0L,                                  # code 0 for asymptomatic\n      missing = NA_integer_                # keep NA as NA (if any)\n    )\n  )\n\n# Fit simple logistic regression model\n# Outcome: symptomatic (1/0)\n# Predictors: Ct value (continuous), lineage group, age in years.\n# This is purely exploratory and *not* the main focus of the project.\n# The main project goal remains descriptive, but this model can be a bonus.\n\nsymp_model <- glm(\n  symptomatic ~ ct_value + lineage_group + age_years,  # model formula\n  data   = Data_xfg %>%\n    dplyr::filter(                                     # keep only complete cases\n      !is.na(symptomatic),\n      !is.na(ct_value),\n      !is.na(age_years),\n      !is.na(lineage_group)\n    ),\n  family = binomial()                                  # logistic regression\n)\n\n# Tidy model output and make a clean, readable table\n# We exponentiate the coefficients to get odds ratios (OR),\n# and then add 95% confidence intervals and p-values.\n\nsymp_results <- broom::tidy(\n  symp_model,\n  conf.int    = TRUE,    # add confidence intervals\n  exponentiate = TRUE    # report OR instead of log-odds\n) %>%\n  dplyr::mutate(\n    # Relabel the term column to something human-readable.\n    # Note: we now have clean term names: \"(Intercept)\", \"ct_value\",\n    # \"lineage_groupOther lineages\", \"age_years\".\n    term = dplyr::case_when(\n      term == \"(Intercept)\" ~\n        \"Intercept (baseline: XFG lineage, younger age)\",\n      term == \"ct_value\" ~\n        \"Ct value (per 1 unit higher)\",\n      term == \"lineage_groupOther lineages\" ~\n        \"Other vs XFG lineages\",\n      term == \"age_years\" ~\n        \"Age (per 1 year older)\",\n      TRUE ~ term                                   # default: keep original\n    ),\n    # Round numbers for a clean table\n    estimate  = round(estimate, 2),                 # odds ratio\n    conf.low  = round(conf.low, 2),                 # lower 95% CI\n    conf.high = round(conf.high, 2),                # upper 95% CI\n    p.value   = signif(p.value, 2)                  # p-value with 2 sig digits\n  ) %>%\n  dplyr::select(\n    Term              = term,                       # rename columns for display\n    `Odds ratio`      = estimate,\n    `95% CI (lower)`  = conf.low,\n    `95% CI (upper)`  = conf.high,\n    `p-value`         = p.value\n  )\n\n# Print the table in a stable, low-bug way\n# Here we use knitr::kable instead of gt. kable is simpler and tends to fail less\n# on Quarto/GitHub Pages.

Nevertheless, confidence intervals were broad and frequently encompass the null, indicating the restricted knowledge derived from merely 21 observations.\n\n## 3.5 Symptom profiles across studies\n```{r symptom-profiles, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\n# This code chunk creates a descriptive bar plot showing, for each participating study (HF, pricos, ResViRe), the proportion of participants reporting each symptom\n# (cough, headache, runny nose, sore throat, chest pain, fever).\n# It is purely descriptive and helps compare symptom patterns across studies for a general audience.\n\n# 1.

Patterns vary among investigations; for instance, respiratory symptoms are more prevalent in the pricos and ResViRe trials compared to HF. However, these discrepancies are derived from limited sample sizes and should be understood intuitively rather than numerically.\n\n# 4. Conclusion and Summary\nThis descriptive analysis of 21 SARS-CoV-2 positive samples from coastal Kenya indicated that the XFG recombinant lineage represented a modest proportion of infections across surveillance studies. It implied restricted local transmission throughout the research period. Ct values and symptom profiles exhibited considerable similarity between XFG and non-XFG lineages, as well as between symptomatic and asymptomatic infections, with only weak and highly ambiguous patterns observed in a limited exploratory regression model.\nDue to the limited sample size, all conclusions should be regarded as illustrative rather than conclusive. This project primarily illustrated the process of importing, cleaning, summarizing, and visualizing a publically available replication dataset with reproducible R and Quarto routines. Subsequent research with larger datasets may implement analogous workflows while integrating more stringent modeling, adjustments for possible confounding factors, and formal uncertainty quantification."},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":"auto","echo":true,"output":true,"warning":false,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"message":false,"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":true,"code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
