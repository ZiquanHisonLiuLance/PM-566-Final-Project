For this project, I downloaded the complete package and stored Data1_xfg.csv in the local data/ directory of the RStudio project (this file is not published to GitHub to maintain data-sharing boundaries). The dataset comprises 21 RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases gathered between May and July 2025 from three surveillance platforms in coastal Kenya.

The variable date_collect was transformed into a Date class with lubridate::dmy(). The lineage variable nextclade_pango2 was reclassified into a more straightforward two-level factor lineage_group (“XFG lineage” vs “Other lineages”). The variables study, clinical_status, and age_group were specifically designated as factors to guarantee uniform ordering in tables and figures. No imputation was conducted."
