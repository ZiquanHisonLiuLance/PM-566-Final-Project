The study comprises 21 people with proven SARS-CoV-2 infection from three surveillance studies undertaken in coastal Kenya: HF, pricos, and ResViRe. Each participant had access to the following essential variables: Study identifier (study: HF, pricos, ResViRe) Demographics: sex, age in years, age group Virologic measures: RT-PCR Ct value (ct_value) and sampling date (date_collect) Genomic lineage designation (nextclade_pango2) Clinical status (clinical_status: asymptomatic vs symptomatic) Symptom indicators (sys_cough, sys_headache, sys_runny_nose, sys_sore_throat, sys_chestpain, sys_fever) Only the 21 observations contained in the replication dataset were examined."

Each of the three surveillance platforms (HF, pricos, and ResViRe) contributed a limited number of participants; thus, all study-specific summaries should be regarded as illustrative rather than exact estimations. In several studies, the majority of subjects indicated experiencing at least one respiratory symptom, including cough, sore throat, or rhinorrhea. Cycle threshold (Ct) values exhibited a wide range, signifying considerable variance in viral RNA levels at the time of sampling. Lineage classifications exhibited heterogeneity, with merely a portion of samples allocated to the XFG recombinant lineage."

The height of each bar indicates the quantity of sequenced infections in the dataset originating from that study. The figure indicates that sample sizes are modest across all platforms and not perfectly balanced, elucidating why certain stratified analyses in the main report remain descriptive and should not be subjected to excessive statistical interpretation."

The majority of participants showed experiencing one to four symptoms, with a limited number of persons reporting either no symptoms or a significantly high number of symptoms. This distribution provided a succinct overview of the total symptom burden within the limited cohort."

The x-axis is represented on a reversed scale, such that lower Ct values, indicative of higher viral load, are positioned on the right. The distribution’s structure indicates that the majority of infections concentrate around moderate Ct levels, with a limited number of exceptionally low or high values.
